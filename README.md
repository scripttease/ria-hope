## Notes
- Edensor free only has one .otf, so it only comes in 1 weight, which may be why it isn't appearing everywhere?
- fontsize branch is outdated

## To Do
- change remotes to balloonicorn
- send dalle design to Ria
- remove vs-code-mac folder, create general notes and shortcuts files in Notes
- fix navigation bug in Chrome - IP6 vs 4?
- collapse nav into a menu button in mobile
