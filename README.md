deno task start
# Run in production
deno run --allow-env --allow-read --allow-net main.ts

## Notes
- Edensor free only has one .otf, so it only comes in 1 weight, which may be why it isn't appearing everywhere?
- fontsize branch is outdated

## To Do
- merge favi branch
- helping you find ground section is only mobile size - make responsive. Branch is 'ground'
- change remotes to balloonicorn
- use dalle design
- remove vs-code-mac folder, create general notes and shortcuts files in Notes
