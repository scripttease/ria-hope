## Quickstart

```sh
# Run in dev
deno task start
# Run in production
deno run --allow-env --allow-read --allow-net main.ts
```

## Notes
Edensor free only has one .otf, so it only comes in 1 weight, which is why it isn't appearing everywhere.

## To Do
- put title and subtitle in SVGs (see main branch) so we can vary size of the free Edensor font
